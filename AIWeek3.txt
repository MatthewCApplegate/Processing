In this short example the we simply create an display a maze on the screen and have a red circle, the hero, 
choose from four possible directions and then if it can move to that block it will. It also lays a large "noBacktrack" block
on the blocks it has visited. If however it should get stuck it will destroy these and turn them in to smaller "crumbs".

Once the hero completes the maze, any blocks without "crumbs" will be turned in to solid blocks as those areas are not needed
to complete the maze.

As the maze is completed it stores a "moves" count and if it goes above that "moves" count it resets it as it
is not going to be more optimised than the last successful completion.

Additionally their is a manually entered "possible" which is the lowest possible amount of moves the maze can be completed in.
Until this number is reached it will keep, re-attempting the maze.
